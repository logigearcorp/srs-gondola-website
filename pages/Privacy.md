There are times when we request information from you, such as when you sign up for our newsletter, download our product, or request assistance on our products and services. The following Privacy Statement provides details about how your personal information is collected and used. This privacy statement applies to the entire web site [www.gondolatest.com](www.gondolatest.com), and customer databases and mailing lists derived from the web site.

The [www.gondolatest.com](www.gondolatest.com) web site offers several opportunities for visitors to register for promotional and informational mailings, to download information, and for assistance in evaluating our products and services.

Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time (see the choice/opt-out section below).

Should we ever enter into contracts with third parties so that they can assist us in servicing you (for example, providing customer service), the contracts will prohibit them from using any of your personal information for their own purposes, and they will be required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them.
